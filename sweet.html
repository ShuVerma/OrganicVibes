    <p class="recipesec">Instructions:</p>
    <p class="recipesec1">For the Gingerbread Crust:</p>
    <ol class="ul">
      <li>Pulse the coconut with crystallized ginger in a blender, to break down the ginger and the coconut flakes to smaller flakes. Pulse a few times and transfer to a bowl.</li>
      <li>Add the rest of the flours, coconut sugar, spices. salt and mix well. Add oil, molasses and maple syrup and mix well. it will take half a minute for the mixture to start looking wet. Get your hands in there to warm up the molasses and mix well. Add a few tsp non dairy milk if needed to make a crumbly dough. Fill the pie pan with the dough and shape into a crust by pressing with your hands inside out.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="recipesec1">For the Pumpkin filling:</p>
    <ol class="ul">
      <li>Mix coconut milk and sugar, starch , chickpea flour in a pan at medium heat. Keep whisking so the sugar and starch dissolves well. Once the sugar has dissolved, add in the pumpkin puree, spices, oil and mix well. Keep stirring with a spatula and bring to somewhat boil. The mixture will keep thickening and some large bubbles will try to escape. 5 to 6 minutes total.</li>
      <li>Continue to stir and cook for another minute or 2. the mixture will visibly thicken and start to leave the pan at some places. You should be able to feel the stiffness in the mixture. Taste carefully and add sugar if needed. Mix in the vanilla and take off heat.</li>
      <li>Let it cool for a minute then pour into the prepared crust. Even it out using a spatula. Let cool for 10 minutes, then refrigerate for a few hours to overnight.</li>
      <li>Top with whipped coconut cream and serve.</li>
